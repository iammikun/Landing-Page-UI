Making this landing page was a tough one. I had every different section in different divs, had so many lines of code that started getting confusing in my eyes so i gave every section a header inside a comment so as to help identify every section.

## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Paddings and,
- Margins
