### My Process
Making this landing page was a tough one. I had every different section in different divs, had so many lines of code that started getting confusing in my eyes so i gave every section a header inside a comment so as to help identify every section.

## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Paddings and,
- Margins

### What I learned
I really learnt a lot during this period of my challenge. It was a relly challenging challenge. Learnt how to semantically arrange my codes in the HTML and also got to knwow new CSS properties.

### continued development
- paddings and spacing
- width and height
- position

### Useful resource
Google fonts - this helped me in getting the font used in my project
